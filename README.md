## Tensorflow/Keras implementation of RISE ##
Original paper by Petsiuk et al.: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07421
----------
This repo was inspired by these great XAI repositories:
https://github.com/marcotcr/lime
https://github.com/eclique/RISE
https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-explain-black-box

----------
Basic usage is as simple as: 
```
from RISE_tf.explain_image import RISE

explainer = RISE()
explanation = explainer.explain(image,model)
```
There are more options including some novel experimental perturbations you can try.

This is an adaptation of 

***"Rise: Randomized input sampling for explanation of black-box models. Petsiuk, V., Das, A., & Saenko, K. (2018)."***  with some additions and adaptations.

A notebook will be included to show some simple usages. The notebook uses VGG19 from tf.keras.application, but it should be easily adaptable to other models. RISE is a model agnostic technique, meaning it can be used as long as you have a function receiving an image input and outputting predictions.

RISE generates explanation heatmaps from the weighted average of perturbation masks generated by a Monte-Carlo approach.
The weight of each mask in the average is related to how much it affects the prediction probabilities.

# Adaptations/changes from the original repo/paper

Some of the main adaptations come in the form of writing a RISE class that uses a tf 2.0/ keras model for predictions. Some small changes in how the batches are passed to the predictor as well.
The original work and repo use only black pixel perturbations. This repo includes some other options (Gaussian blur, b&w vs colored noise), but these new options are there just as an experimental test. The source code should also make it easy to implement new types of perturbations if desired.
The default however is the black pixel perturbations used in the original repo and paper.

This repo is a work in progress.
